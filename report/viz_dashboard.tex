\subsection{Dashboard} \label{viz_dashboard}
Due to despairing data sources, sometimes it becomes harder to
generate a relationship between datasets, in this case creating
dashboards may seem illogical because the filters would not flow
through to all the visualizations generated. Tableau give us a great
story telling template that allows users to explore such dataset and
make sense of what the data is trying to show. Dashboards can also be
incorporated in the storyline with the same concept of painting the
big picture.
