\subsection{Top Referrals} \label{viztoprefs}
<TODO: Leonard>
Top Referrals data set shows the referring site to <>. To visualize
top referrals, we used bar chart and restricted our data to top 10 due
to shear number of referral. Using bar chart to visualize the data,
allows the users to quickly identify the trend of referrals and helps
to know where to invest based on traffic.
